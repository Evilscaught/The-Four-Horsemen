REMINDERS:
  Things to avoid:
    CSS won't be able to update buttons if their color properties were set in the FXML files using Gluon Scene Builder
	
	Where I left off (June 20ish, 2018): 
		=Pressing ENTER key at login-screen now relies on style.css to update.
		=Login Button now relies on style.css to update. 
		=All other buttons in password recovery rely on style.css to update
		
	Bugs found:
		Resetting password allows you to enter commas.
		There is no option to toggle password visiblity when resetting password.
		
	Ideas:
		In the text fields (when creating accounts, transactions, etc.), instead of changing their style in Java, 
    use that pseudoclass method instead that will change them using the style.css file. 
    (Refer to login button when pressing enter, method initialize() in loginScreenController.java)
